At approximately 6:00 am on the same day as experiencing the chills, I experienced abdominal pains, which lasted approximately 1 hour and resolved on their own." ,     ,         ,         ,         ,         ,         ,       ,        ,Y      ,12/28/2020 ,12/29/2020 ,1       ,None                                                          ,PUB       ,         ,"Amlodipine, Ambien, Benicar/HCTZ, Invokana, Metformin, Levothyroxine, Bydureon, Metoprolol"                                                                                                                                                      ,None                                                      ,"High blood pressure, high cholesterol, sleep apnea, insomnia, diabetes type II, obesity." ,                                                                                         ,         ,2         ,01/01/2021  ,             ,          ,            ,Penicillin
